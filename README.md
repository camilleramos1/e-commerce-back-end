## Description
Using starter code, I created the back end functionality and api routes for an e-commerce platform. I used Nodejs, Express.js, Sequelize, and MySQL. Using Express.js, I was able to make a functioning API for the information found in the sql files. Using Sequelize, I was able to pull data from the seeds files as objects in order to make the data easier to work with. With the help of the dotenv npm package, I used environment variables to store mySQL username and password.

## Installation
Clone this repo, and ensure you have Nodejs installed. Install all dependencies, and source the schema and seed file using mySQL. Use 'npm run seed' to seed data to your database. Use 'node server.js' in your terminal to start the port 3001 server.

## Usage
Once the user has started the server using their terminal, they will be able to test the various routes. The routes that are accessible are: 
/categories, /products, and /tags. 
From there, you can decide what type of route you would like to view using each of the routes individual files as reference. Each api route has 5 additional routes, those being GET(ALL), GET(ONE), POST, PUT, and DELETE.
